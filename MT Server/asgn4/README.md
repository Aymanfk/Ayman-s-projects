# Assignment 4 directory

## Issues: I couldnt get my regex to work with put requests.

## Credits: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14634553/c-using-getopt-to-parse-multiple-arguments (for my main function I followed this link, as well as this link:https://nachtimwald.com/2019/04/12/thread-pool-in-c/ for my threadpool and worker.) I also used chatgpt for overall debugging and the hashtable I built I must cite to chat gpt which helped fix a hashtable I had built a while ago, and simplified it to work with what i need for this assignment in terms of changing the logic to work with locks.
